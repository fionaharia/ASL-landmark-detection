# ASL Landmark Detection
This repository contains the code and models for detecting hand landmarks in real-time using American Sign Language (ASL). The project focuses on recognizing ASL gestures by processing hand movement landmarks captured through a webcam or video input.

By using Python libraries like Mediapipe for landmark detection and Scikit-learn for classification, the project allows users to create a dataset, train a classifier, and test it with various ASL hand gestures.

## Features

- Real-time hand landmark detection using Mediapipe.
- ASL gesture classification using a machine learning classifier.
- Script to collect images and build a dataset for training.
- Custom dataset creation for ASL signs.
- Supports training, testing, and visualizing results.
